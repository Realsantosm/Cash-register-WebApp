Enter the amount a customer paid and check, How much return back!
This is a like a calculator which tells us how much amount as well as 
how many different number of notes need to be returned.

## How this calculator works :
1. There are two input box
2. There are two buttons but when we enter the first input and click the button on its side then only the next input and button will display.
3. We have checked its validation like what if a user leaves the input section blank and then clicks on the button : it automatically send and alert showing inner the bill. Again one case is that if a person enter the letter it will not accept it as we have changed its type to number and also transformed it to Integer.
4. Even on the second button we have checked out the cases which can occur.
5. We have inserted the loader button till the results are out it keeps running.
6. Then the output is laid in the table.
